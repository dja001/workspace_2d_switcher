2D switcher for workspaces linux mint 

Intended for use as a custom keyboard shortcut.
Can be made to work with any shortcut you like!

Wraps around like in old NES games


2D layout for the workspaces is provided by the "workspace grid (2D) and switcher" applet.
The "xdotool" is used for switching between workspaces.
Both must be installed for this to work

Works for me (linux mint 20.1) See comment in the script for usage.
